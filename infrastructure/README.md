# Infrastructure Setup for Playground

This directory contains the Terraform configuration files required to deploy the infrastructure for the **Playground** in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The setup is divided into two main components:

- **`terraform/gcloud/app/`**: Deploys the application infrastructure (e.g., compute instances, networking).
- **`terraform/gcloud/iam/`**: Configures Identity and Access Management (IAM), including roles, service accounts, and permissions.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

- **`gcloud/app/`**  
  Handles the deployment of the application infrastructure necessary for the Playground. This includes:
